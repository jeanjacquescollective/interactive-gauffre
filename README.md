Waffle d'liège
Jannes Lambrecht, Bergen (NO), 1994
Mirthe Vermunicht, Leuven (BE), 1999 

Mirthe Vermunicht and Jannes Lambrecht came together to craft a unique and interactive homage to the centuries-old Liège waffle tradition. Their creation invites passers-by to participate in a tactile experience by pouring golden syrup over a waffle with their own hands, forging a tangible link to the rich history of this beloved delicacy. This fusion of art and gastronomy serves as a testament to their creative synergy and inventive spirit.

As a creator, Jannes Lambrecht (also known as Blikschade) focuses on immersive visuals and exploring the realms of retro and new technology. His diverse portfolio spans from captivating installations showcased at events like the Light Festival Ghent to crafting visuals for venues like Vooruit in Chinastraat, along with web development and numerous smaller projects. Jannes is also part of the Jean-Jacques Collective where they bring art to people and people to art, mostly known for organising collaborative projects. Behind the scenes he likes to work as a voltunteer and organises small festivals and opportunities for artists and musicians.

Mirthe Vermunicht, an art enthusiast with a multifaceted background in graphic design, illustration, ceramics, and scenography, has a rich history as a freelance graphic designer for a myriad of applications. 
In this collaboration with Jannes she showcases her commitment to pushing the boundaries of artistic expression. 
Together, Mirthe and Jannes have crafted an immersive experience that not only pays homage to a culinary tradition but also exemplifies their dedication to artistry and innovation.
